<p>Head First <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank"><strong>Html</strong></a> and CSS is a most entertaining book for learning how to build a great web
page. It not only covers everything you need to know about HTML and CSS, it also excels in
explaining everything in layman’s terms with a lot of great examples. I found the book truly
enjoyable to read, and I learned something new!</p>

<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<p>This book has humor and charm, but most importantly, it has heart. I know that sounds
ridiculous to say about a technical book, but I really sense that at its core, this book (or at least
its authors) really care that the reader learns the material. This comes across in the style, the
language, and the techniques. Learning—real understanding and comprehension—on the part
of the reader is clearly topmost in the minds of the authors. And thank you, thank you, thank
you, for the book’s strong and sensible advocacy of standards compliance. It’s great to see an
entry-level book, that I think will be widely read and studied, campaign so eloquently and
persuasively on behalf of the value of standards compliance in web page code. I even found
in here a few great arguments I had not thought of—ones I can remember and use when I am
asked (as I still am)—‘what’s the deal with compliance and why should we care?’ I’ll have more
ammo now! I also liked that the book sprinkles in some basics about the mechanics of actually
getting a web page live—FTP, web server basics, file structures, etc.”</p>
